# Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation

This project implements a Quantum Monte Carlo simulation inspired by the paper "Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation" by Yazhen Wang. It uses Qiskit to simulate time evolution via Trotter decomposition and estimates observables through repeated quantum measurements.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/quantum_monte_carlo_simulation.git
cd quantum_monte_carlo_simulation
