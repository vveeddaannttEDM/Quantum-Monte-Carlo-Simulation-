Initialization:
We use 2 qubits and prepare them in a superposition state using Hadamard gates.
Trotterized Time Evolution:
We apply a basic Trotter-Suzuki decomposition to approximate the evolution of a simple Hamiltonian.
Observable Measurement:
The observable is chosen as the Z operator on the first qubit. Measurements are repeated to estimate the expectation value.
Monte Carlo Iterations:
We run the simulation multiple times to gather statistical data, mimicking the Monte Carlo method described in the paper.
Analysis:
The mean and variance of the observable are computed to analyze the accuracy of the simulation.
